# Character-Game
Our Game is called "Character Game" because it tells about two characters which will fight with each other.\
It  uses Object-Oriented Programming and the thread method which allows us to fight with opponent at the same time.
To improve your character you can go to shops at the map and add some great things :) \
So, just download it and show me what do you can! :)

Our Game consists of 7 main folders:\
1.Battle- There are classes which are responsible for battle of the Character(our figure) and Opponent(computer).\
2.BeginAndGameFinish- There are classes which are responsible for starting the game.\
3.Buildings- There are buildings of our map and classes which define what is inside each building.\
4.Characters- In this class we define all of our characters and opponents. \
    There are also classes wich define other options which will appear in the game such as Increase Mode or Decrease Mode.\
5.Map- There is a map of our town.\
6.Tools- There are some classes wchich help us to clear our code
